# TechNest: AI-Powered Retail Solution

## 🚀 Feynn Labs Virtual Internship Project

This repository contains the work completed during my virtual internship as a Data Analyst at Feynn Labs under the mentorship of [Mr. Sanjay Basumatary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjay-basumatary-326021b5/).

## 📋 Project Overview

**TechNest** is an AI-powered retail solution designed to bridge the gap between local electronics retailers and digital consumers. The platform enhances the digital presence of local retailers by enabling real-time price comparison, product discovery, and personalized recommendations.

### 🎯 Problem Statement

The traditional electronics retail industry faces significant challenges:
- Limited digital visibility for local retailers
- Lack of price transparency for consumers
- Difficulty competing with e-commerce giants
- Changing consumer shopping behaviors

### 🌟 Solution

Our platform transforms the retail experience by helping local retailers establish a competitive online presence through:
- Real-time price comparison with online marketplaces
- AI-driven product recommendations
- Seamless demo booking services
- Data analytics for retailers

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Machine Learning Model

We implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for our recommendation system, which:
- Uses product price and store location as key features
- Provides personalized product recommendations to users
- Helps consumers find the best local deals based on their preferences

### System Architecture

The platform integrates:
- **Machine Learning Service**: KNN & K-Means Clustering
- **Recommendation Engine**: AI-driven product suggestions

## 📊 Business Analysis

### Target Audience

**Consumers:**
- Tech-savvy shoppers who research before buying
- Working professionals and students
- Bargain hunters looking for the best deals
- Brand-conscious buyers
